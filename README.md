# E-commerce Website and App data

# 1. Introduction

In this project, I build a Multiple Linear Regression model on the data of E-commerce company based in New York City that sells clothing online but they also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions. 

  I discuss the basics of linear regression and its implementation in Python programming language using Scikit-learn. Scikit-learn is the popular machine learning library of Python programming language.

# 2. Tools and Technology:

- Python with Jupter Notebook
- Numpy - It provides a fast numerical array structure and operating functions.
- Pandas - It provides tools for data storage, manipulation and analysis tasks.
- Matplotlib - It is the basic plotting library in Python. It provides tools for making plots.
- Seaborn - It is also used in visualization.
- Scikit learn - The required machine learning library in Python.

# 3. Problem Statement:

The aim of building a machine learning model is to solve a problem and to define a metric to measure model performance. So, first of all I have to define the problem to be solved in this project. Ecommerce company based in New York City that sells clothing online but they also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions. The company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website.  I have used two performance metrics RMSE (Root Mean Square Value) and R2 Score value to compute our model performance.

# 5. Conclusion:

The company should focus on the App rather than a Website.
